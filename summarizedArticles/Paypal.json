[{"2018-09-21":["SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 PayPal has become the latest tech giant to cut off Infowars, the conspiracy website run by the right-wing provocateur Alex Jones.Infowars was informed by PayPal on Thursday night that it would have 10 business days to find a new payment processor.PayPal handles all transactions, including credit cards, for the Infowars online store. The store has been a significant source of revenue for the company, selling vitamins and nutritional supplements, as well as Infowars-branded apparel. PayPal has also handled donations that Infowars receives from its supporters.PayPal acted weeks after Twitter, Facebook and other large tech companies blocked Infowars from their services. Most of those companies said the site had violated their policies by promoting hate speech and misinformation.PayPal said it had made its decision not because of any policy violation but because Infowars\u2019 \u201cpromotion of hate and discrimination runs counter to our core value of inclusion.\u201d\u201cOur values are the foundation for the decision we made this week,\u201d PayPal added.The aggressive steps against Infowars have become fodder for claims that Silicon Valley companies are biased against conservative voices \u2014 an opinion expressed by President Trump and a number of Republican officials. Jeff Sessions, the United States attorney general, plans to meet with Republican state attorneys general next week to discuss the tech industry, competition and free speech.Mr. Jones attended a recent Senate hearing where Twitter\u2019s Jack Dorsey and Facebook\u2019s Sheryl Sandberg discussed efforts by their companies to deal with disinformation on their platforms. And after a separate House hearing that directly addressed Republican claims that Twitter was biased against conservatives, Mr. Jones tried to confront Mr. Dorsey on Mr. Dorsey\u2019s way out.After the phaseout period of 10 business days, PayPal will stop doing any business with Infowars and its subsidiaries, like the site Prison Planet, a PayPal spokesman said.The spokesman declined to cite any specific problems that had led to the decision, but said that after \u201cextensive reviews\u201d the company had \u201cfound many instances of content that promoted hate and discriminatory intolerance against certain communities and religions.\u201dThis is not the first time that PayPal has waded into politically fraught territory. In 2010, the company cut off payments to WikiLeaks. More recently, PayPal stopped working with neo-Nazi and alt-right websites.Records from 2014 show that Mr. Jones\u2019s operations were bringing in nearly $20 million, mostly from supplements, such as Super Male Vitality, which purports to increase testosterone, that he hawks on his radio shows, The New York Times recently reported.Since being barred from Facebook and Twitter, Infowars has had to find new online platforms, and its audience has fallen off significantly. But PayPal\u2019s decision may be particularly damaging, because it will be much harder for Infowars to find another company to handle transactions for the site.For now, Infowars is still able to sell at least some of its goods on Amazon and eBay, where its payments are not handled by PayPal.An article on the Infowars site that announced PayPal\u2019s decision said the move was a \u201cpolitical ploy designed to financially sabotage an influential media outlet just weeks before the midterm elections.\u201dThe article said PayPal had told Infowars that the decision was made because Infowars had violated its \u201cacceptable use policy.\u201d PayPal\u2019s spokesman said its decision went beyond the violation of any single policy.Right Wing Watch, a progressive advocacy organization, published an article in August pointing out areas where Infowars appeared to be violating PayPal\u2019s terms of service. At the time, PayPal did not take action and offered no comment.Infowars did not respond to an email requesting comment."],"2018-07-11":["Three weeks after a British man told PayPal that his wife had died at 37 and that her credit account should be closed, he opened a letter from the company: Her death, it seemed, was in violation of the company\u2019s contract rules.\u201cYou are in breach of condition 15.4(c) of your agreement with PayPal Credit as we have received notice that you are deceased,\u201d said the July 10 letter to the woman, Lindsay Durdle, who had died of breast cancer on May 31.Her husband of nearly 10 years, Howard Durdle, 40, of Bucklebury, read the company\u2019s list of potential consequences: shutting down her account, requiring repayment of more than $4,000 in debt, and even legal action.In Britain, spouses are not automatically responsible for their deceased partners\u2019 debts. Such debts must be paid through the estate of the person who died, including money or possessions. Mr. Durdle said his wife\u2019s estate could not cover her debt.\u201cWith grief, there are ups and downs,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are days when you are very fragile, and there are days when you are feeling stronger. We are lucky that this week I was feeling quite strong.\u201dPayPal said in a statement on Wednesday that it apologized \u201cfor the understandable distress this letter caused\u201d and that it had \u201cquickly performed a thorough investigation.\u201d\u201cAs soon as our teams became aware of this mistake, we contacted Mr. Durdle directly to offer our support, cleared the outstanding debt and closed down his wife\u2019s account as he requested,\u201d the company said. \u201cWe have also urgently reviewed the company\u2019s internal processes and have made changes to ensure that an insensitive error of this nature never happens again.\u201dA PayPal spokesman declined to specify how such a letter was sent in the first place or what changes had been made since the episode. Mr. Durdle said a representative for the company told him by phone that the letter possibly stemmed from a software glitch, a poor letter template or a human mistake.\u201cI believe they want to fix that and make it good,\u201d Mr. Durdle said.The letter highlighted a continuing debate over how sensitive companies should be to the bereaved.In 2014, OfficeMax faced criticism over its marketing after the father of a teenager killed in a car crash received a promotional mailer addressed to \u201cMike Seay/Daughter Killed in Car Crash/Or Current Business,\u201d The New Yorker reported. The same year, Facebook came under scrutiny for its \u201cYear in Review\u201d feature, which showed a man pictures of his dead daughter, according to CNN.Companies should think about how, when targeting potential customers, to better take into account unexpected personal tragedies like death, said Adam Galinsky, a professor at Columbia Business School. He called the PayPal letter an \u201cegregious failure.\u201d\u201cIt can create a strong backlash against companies,\u201d he said.Robert Weissman, the president of the nonprofit group Public Citizen, which advocates consumer rights, said companies could continue to face public relations problems surrounding sensitivity as they increasingly use algorithms to dictate outreach and marketing.\u201cIt would be a fair bet that the increasing reliance on them is going to lead to more mistakes,\u201d he said.Big banks already put an emphasis on sensitivity when trying to collect on debts owed by the deceased, said Manuel H. Newburger, a lawyer who teaches consumer law at the University of Texas at Austin. Banks often hire third-party companies that specialize in communicating to families, Mr. Newburger said, and while mishaps are rare, they have garnered the scrutiny of federal regulators.\u201cIt\u2019s too high profile, it\u2019s too newsworthy,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that makes it hard for companies to get away with this without facing a lot of pushback.\u201dMr. Durdle said he wanted companies like PayPal to do better.\u201cThe reason I\u2019m making the noise about it that I am is to try to draw some attention to it so that doesn\u2019t happen again,\u201d he said. \u201cIt can be hugely damaging for people who are trying to recover.\u201dMr. Durdle, an information security executive, said he met his wife on Match.com in 2006, and they married three years later. They bonded over video games, often playing Xbox together. Mrs. Durdle, a strategy analyst for a water utility, first learned she had cancer more than a year and a half ago, but last summer, it seemed as if she had beaten the cancer back.The two bought a home in Bucklebury, about 50 miles west of London, before the cancer returned.Mr. Durdle said that his 40th birthday, at the end of June, was the date Mrs. Durdle had been \u201ctrying to hold out for.\u201d\u201cShe died just a month shy,\u201d he said."],"2018-07-27":["Dan Schulman, the chief executive of PayPal, knows how to fight. He climbed to a senior executive role at AT&T before he was 40, jumped ship to work at Priceline when the travel website was still a start-up, then took Virgin Mobile USA from an idea to a business with five million subscribers. After stops at Sprint and American Express, Mr. Schulman joined PayPal in 2014, overseeing its split from eBay the next year. Since then, PayPal\u2019s stock has more than doubled, quieting doubters who wondered if the online payments company would be a sustainable business over the long term. He is also a regular practitioner of Krav Maga, the martial art system practiced by the Israeli military, and has the scars to prove it. This interview, which was condensed and edited for clarity, was conducted at PayPal\u2019s offices in New York. What was your childhood like? I grew up in New Jersey, first Newark and then New Brunswick. We lived in a fully integrated neighborhood. My mom was an activist. She pushed me in a baby carriage at a Martin Luther King Jr. rally. She marched in the civil rights marches, not just in the North but in the South as well. It takes courage to go and do that. You started working for AT&T right out of school and wound up staying there for 18 years. What did you learn during that time? Early on in my career I had a family tragedy where my sister died, and I was leading a team at the time. That was a devastating time for me and my family. I had to take time off. I came back several months later and the team had just gelled together to say, \u201cWe\u2019re going to cover for Dan. We\u2019re going to do everything.\u201d And when I was presenting to the AT&T board about the accomplishments of this team, I couldn\u2019t take any credit because I deserved no credit. This idea of the power of giving credit to others \u2014 as opposed to your own individual accomplishment \u2014 has shaped my entire career. Most people don\u2019t really think about that. They mostly think, \u201cLook at me.\u201d But really if you say, \u201cLook at what others are accomplishing,\u201d it\u2019s so much more powerful in terms of your ability to attract the best people, to get things done.You left AT&T for Priceline when it was just a start-up. That was a big risk. Why not just stay at AT&T?I was president of the consumer division at age 39 or so. But my view was not so much that leaving was a risk. I actually thought it\u2019s more risky to stand still. There\u2019s a philosophy in martial arts which is, \u201cNever stand still.\u201d Standing still is asking to be hit. You always have to be willing to take some risks going forward. You can\u2019t stand still. I have this advice that I give to people I mentor. I always say, \u201cDon\u2019t overthink your next step, because none of us know where we\u2019re going to be 10 years from now or 15 years from now.\u201d One step leads to another. What changes have you made to PayPal\u2019s organizational structure as C.E.O. ?I\u2019ve taken my team from 21 direct reports to eight direct reports. To me, a great team is one that discusses all of the issues. When you have 21 people, it\u2019s not a discussion; it\u2019s a presentation. There\u2019s no way that 21 voices can be heard around a table. It\u2019s a cacophony of voices. The smaller the team is, the more you can discuss issues in depth and detail, and there becomes a trust among the team. PayPal was one of the first financial companies to take a stand on guns. How did you arrive at that decision?If you\u2019re going to have a consistent set of values that you stand up for, they have to be reflected in your acceptable use policy. Around the violence in Charlottesville, we identified a number of groups that espouse hate or violence, and we don\u2019t allow them to use PayPal to fund-raise. And we do not allow PayPal to be used for guns and ammunition. That there are rules and regulations in terms of background checks is extraordinarily important. But if somebody is going to do something online, we can\u2019t fully vouch for those background checks. And so therefore we just outlaw it. It\u2019s not always comfortable for C.E.O.s to take a stand on these issues. How do you decide where to draw that line?Companies, and by extension their management teams and their C.E.O.s, have a moral obligation to try to be a force for good. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any way that we can shirk that responsibility, and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any way to fully stand away from the culture wars around us. You have to take a stand. That stand shouldn\u2019t be a political one. But it should be one that is based on your values and your mission. You practice martial arts, right?I practice Krav Maga. I spent some time in Israel when I was young, and they have what\u2019s called Youth Military Training there, so I started then. That was when I was in my teens, and I\u2019ve been doing Krav since then.Have you ever gotten hurt?Oh my gosh. I mean, look at my knuckles. These are all from punches. I\u2019m always black or blue or I have some scar on my face. I've dislocated my shoulder. I've had stitches. If you look carefully on my face, stitches here, stitches here. Smacked into a mat here, here. That\u2019s how you learn how to be cool, calm and collected in very stressful situations.But the overrunning philosophy of Krav is that the best way to win a fight is to not get into a fight. It's very Zen in that way. How do you de-escalate situations? We spend a lot of time thinking about that. It's translated into the way that I think about business as well. When we started partnering with Visa and Mastercard and JPMorgan Chase and Citi, nobody ever thought that PayPal would be allies with those companies. That would always be an uneasy friend relationship. But my view is, \u201cHow do you give customers the choice they want, and how do you avoid fights that you don\u2019t necessarily need to be in?\u201d And it was maybe one of the key things that catapulted PayPal\u2019s success in recent years.A reader on Twitter, Kyle Rosenbaum, asked about India\u2019s effort to ban cash. Do you think we\u2019ll see more countries doing that in the future? There are two mega-trends happening right now in the financial services industry. One: You\u2019re seeing the digitization of payments. People are moving away from checks. People are slowly but surely moving away from cash. That\u2019s driven by the other big trend, which is the explosion of smartphones. In smartphones, you have all of the power of a bank branch in the palm of your hand. You can do basic transactions at a fraction of the cost and a fraction of the time that it took you before. That can enable so many of these underserved populations to come into the mainstream as well and do things that perhaps you and I take for granted, and it can actually make a real difference in their lives. The demonetization in India is one of the most audacious and bold experiments that a government has done. India is one of the last places you would think that would try to get rid of cash, but there's a huge issue that goes on. There's a huge amount of graft and corruption. But if the government can directly send that money to you electronically, right into a digital account or a bank account, that could be incredibly impactful in that country. Whether it fully works or not, it is a harbinger of things to come.What do you still use cash for?I don\u2019t use a lot of cash right now. Things that I used to use cash for, like paying babysitters, now everybody has Venmo and it\u2019s simpler and easier. Some people feel that cash is a more anonymous form of payment, and I would never predict the death of cash over the next decade or two. I think cash is going to be with us for a long time to come. But there is a clear trend toward digitization. It\u2019s just a more efficient, time-efficient, cost-efficient way to managing your money."],"2018-05-17":["LONDON \u2014 Seeking to extend its global reach, PayPal has reached a deal to buy iZettle, Europe\u2019s answer to the mobile payments company Square, for about $2.2 billion.The deal would be the company\u2019s biggest takeover \u2014 and would underscore the arms race in the world of payments, especially as digital and mobile transactions are increasingly being adopted across the world. The agreement was confirmed Thursday by Amanda Miller, a spokeswoman for PayPal.\u201cSmall businesses are the engine of the global economy and we are continuing to expand our platform to help them compete and win online, in-store and via mobile,\u201d said PayPal\u2019s chief executive, Dan Schulman.The talks were earlier reported by Sky News. IZettle did not respond to a request for comment.The agreement is the latest example of a promising European start-up selling itself to a larger American company. Amazon, Apple, Google, Facebook and Microsoft have all used acquisitions in the region to gobble up promising technology and sought-after engineers. Past deals include Google\u2019s purchase of the London-based artificial intelligence start-up DeepMind; Microsoft\u2019s acquisition of Mojang, the Swedish maker of popular video game \u201cMinecraft\u201d; and Apple\u2019s deal for the music-recognition company Shazam and digital-assistant maker VocalIQ, both of which started in Europe.The trend is troubling for European policymakers who have been eager to develop a homegrown tech sector that has lagged the United States and China.Founded eight years ago and based in Stockholm, iZettle began as a maker of products like credit card readers. But it has expanded its offerings to analytics software and even small business loans, giving it a strong foothold among such companies in Europe and Latin America.Last week, it filed to go public, announcing plans to list itself on the Nasdaq Stockholm stock exchange, with ambitions for a $1.1 billion valuation. Among its existing investors are Mastercard and American Express, as well as the venture capital firm Index Ventures.The purchase would boost PayPal\u2019s international expansion, and help it compete with Square, which has focused on processing payments for small businesses. Both companies are trying to capitalize on the growing volume of purchases being made on mobile phones and the internet."],"2017-08-04":["Investors liked what they saw in PayPal\u2019s second-quarter financial results, reported by the digital and mobile payments giant on July 26. Revenues grew to $3.14 billion in the quarter that ended in June, an increase of 18 percent over the same period last year. Total payment volume of $106 billion was up 23 percent, year over year.Even better, PayPal\u2019s favored earnings-per-share measure \u2014 which it does not calculate in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP \u2014 came in at 46 cents per share, 3 cents more than Wall Street analysts had expected. The company has trained investors to focus on this number, rather than on the less pretty GAAP-compliant numbers most companies are judged by. And focus they did.Exceeding analysts\u2019 estimates \u2014 \u201cbeating the number,\u201d in Wall Street parlance \u2014 is crucial for any corporate leader interested in keeping his or her stock price aloft. Even the smallest earnings miss can send shares tumbling.Examining how a company meets or beats analysts\u2019 estimates, therefore, can be illuminating.PayPal\u2019s stock has been on a tear this year, up almost 50 percent since January. At a recent $59, its shares are trading at over 40 times next year\u2019s earnings estimates. It is clearly an investor darling, providing all the more reason to dig into its numbers.Naturally, many factors contributed to PayPal\u2019s second-quarter earnings. But one element stands out: the amount the company dispensed to employees in the form of stock-based compensation.How could stock-based compensation \u2014 which is a company expense, after all \u2014 have helped PayPal\u2019s performance in the quarter? Simple. The company does not consider stock awards a cost when calculating its favored earnings measure. So when PayPal doles out more stock compensation than it has done historically, all else being equal, its chosen non-GAAP income growth looks better.Accounting rules have required companies to include stock-based compensation as a cost of doing business for years. That\u2019s as it should be: Stock awards have value, after all, or employees wouldn\u2019t accept them as pay. And that value should be run through a company\u2019s financial statements as an expense.Consider the practice at Facebook, a company PayPal identifies as a peer. In its most recent quarterly income statement, Facebook broke out the roughly $1 billion in costs associated with share-based compensation that it deducted from its $9.3 billion in revenues.Back in the 1990s, technology companies argued strenuously against having to run stock compensation costs through their profit-and-loss statements. Who can blame them for wanting to make an expense disappear?They lost that battle with the accounting rule makers. But then they took a new tack: Technology companies began providing alternative earnings calculations without such costs alongside results that were accounted for under GAAP, essentially offering two sets of numbers every quarter. The non-GAAP statements \u2014 called pro forma numbers or adjusted results \u2014 often exclude expenses like stock awards and acquisition costs. And the equity analysts who hold such sway on Wall Street seem to be fine with them.As long as companies also showed their results under generally accepted accounting rules, the Securities and Exchange Commission let them present their favored alternative accounting.PayPal is by no means the only company that adds back the costs of stock-based compensation to its unconventional earnings calculations. Many technology companies do, contending, as PayPal does, that their own arithmetic \u201cprovides investors a consistent basis for assessing the company\u2019s performance and helps to facilitate comparisons across different periods.\u201dStill, some technology leaders are dumping the practice. In addition to Facebook, Alphabet said this year that it would no longer present results that excluded the costs of stock-based compensation.Dave Wehner, Facebook\u2019s chief financial officer, told investors on a May conference call that the company would report results that include share-based compensation because it\u2019s a true cost of running the business.Ruth Porat, chief financial officer of Alphabet, which is Google\u2019s parent company, said the same thing on a conference call in January.PayPal takes the opposite approach. And look at what it does to its results.Under generally accepted accounting principles, PayPal reported operating income of $430 million in the second quarter of 2017. That was up almost 16 percent from the $371 million it produced in the same period last year.But under PayPal\u2019s alternative accounting, its non-GAAP operating income was $659 million in the June quarter, an increase of almost 25 percent from 2016.So what\u2019s to account for the added $230 million in operating income under PayPal\u2019s preferred calculation? Most of it \u2014 $192 million \u2014 was stock-based compensation PayPal dispensed to employees in the June quarter and added back to its results as calculated under GAAP.That was a big jump \u2014 57 percent \u2014 from the $122 million PayPal handed out during the second quarter of 2016. And back in 2015, PayPal reported just $89 million in stock awards.I asked PayPal why it has been ratcheting up its stock-based compensation. Amanda Miller, a PayPal spokeswoman, declined to discuss why the company was raising its stock-based pay, and the role the increase played in the company\u2019s recent results. She provided this statement: \u201cWe pay for performance and align our compensation with how shareholders are rewarded. We believe our treatment of stock-based compensation is broadly consistent with our peer group.\u201dBut this isn\u2019t accurate, according to the companies PayPal lists as peers in its proxy filing. At least four of those companies \u2014 Alphabet, Facebook, Mastercard and Visa \u2014 do not exclude stock-based compensation from their earnings calculations as PayPal does.Craig Maurer is a partner at Autonomous, an independent investment research firm in New York. He follows payments companies and rates PayPal\u2019s stock an underperformer.In a telephone interview, Mr. Maurer was critical of how the company accounts for stock-based pay. He said that as a percentage of PayPal\u2019s non-GAAP operating income, stock-based compensation has risen to 29 percent this year from 17 percent in 2015.\u201cThey are literally taking a cost out of their income statement, moving it to a different line and backing it out of results,\u201d Mr. Maurer said in an interview. \u201cAnd you can see that it\u2019s adding significantly to their ability to meet earnings expectations. If you backed out the difference between what we were expecting on stock-based comp in the quarter versus what they reported, it was 2 cents of earnings.\u201dIn other words, the increase in stock-based compensation made a big contribution to PayPal\u2019s results versus what analysts had been expecting.PayPal\u2019s stock-based compensation practices have another noteworthy effect: They drive executive pay higher at the company. Here\u2019s how.The company says it has three main metrics for calculating its managers\u2019 performance pay each year. One of those measures, its proxy shows, is non-GAAP net income. So, as PayPal awards more and more stock to its executives and employees, non-GAAP net income shows better growth. And the greater that growth, the more incentive pay the company awards to its top executives.For PayPal insiders, at least, that\u2019s one virtuous circle."],"2017-03-01":["When Terry Kass received an email from PayPal in late December encouraging her to donate to charities through its Giving Fund platform, she searched its website for ones she could help. She settled on 13 groups \u2014 most in her Chicago suburb \u2014 and gave a total of $3,700 to them.But when Ms. Kass followed up with one of the recipients, the Highland Park-Highwood Legal Aid Clinic, she discovered that the group had not been notified about her gift, nor had even received it. It was not a fluke, she said. She learned that 10 of the 13 groups \u2014 all of which had profile pages on the PayPal site that included biographical information and mission statements \u2014 were also unaware of donations through the site, she said.A federal class action lawsuit filed on Tuesday said that Ms. Kass and thousands of other donors have been misled by PayPal Giving Fund, and that their gifts never reached the intended charities. The company has a policy of redirecting contributions to other organizations if the intended charity does not register an account with the site, Ms. Kass said, adding that neither donors nor intended charities are informed of any switch.\u201cI don\u2019t want to file my taxes to the federal government saying I gave to a charity that never got my money,\u201d Ms. Kass, a retired lawyer, said in an interview. \u201cIt\u2019s their money. They are entitled to the money.\u201dThe philanthropic website by PayPal, the digital payment company, has become a major player in online fund-raising for charitable organizations worldwide, processing $7.3 billion in contributions last year. The Giving Fund site lists over one million organizations that can receive gifts, from well-known international nonprofits like Save the Children to obscure animal shelters like the Yogie and Friends Exotic Cat Sanctuary in Louisiana.Despite promises that 100 percent of donations go to the selected charities, the gifts are delivered only if the groups register accounts on both PayPal and the Giving Fund site, the lawsuit says.The lawsuit, filed in the Federal District Court of Northern Illinois, claims that hundreds of thousands of charities have never received donations earmarked for them.\u201cThe bottom line is that many, many entities listed on the website are not actually registered,\u201d Chris Dore, a lawyer representing Ms. Kass, said in an interview. \u201cIt is something that is really concerning and shocking.\u201dDonors are not informed before or after making a donation whether their intended charities have accounts, Ms. Kass said. In a frequently asked questions section on the Giving Fund\u2019s site, it says that organizations not enrolled will be informed of the donations and be given at least six months to register accounts to claim the gifts. Otherwise, it says, \u201cWe may reassign their funds to another charitable organization.\u201dA spokesman at PayPal did not respond to questions about how much money has been redirected and how the company decides which groups receive them. In a statement on Wednesday, a spokesman said that the company was reviewing the lawsuit.PayPal released a statement on Thursday saying it has not redirected any charitable contributions made during the recent holiday giving season, the period in which Ms. Kass said she made her donations through the site. \u201cWe are disappointed by the lawsuit, and we are fully prepared to defend ourselves vigorously,\u201d it said.Ms. Kass said she decided to contribute to groups through the Giving Fund site because in a Dec. 30 email it said it would waive the usual transactional fees and give an additional 1 percent to the selected charities for gifts made by year\u2019s end.Her family, including her three children, helped pick the 13 groups for donations. She gave $2,500 to the Highland Park-Highwood Legal Aid Clinic, where she is a board member, and also $200 to the DC Central Kitchen in Washington, which is run by a family friend.She first noticed something was awry at a legal aid board meeting in January when the executive director reviewed the group\u2019s charitable donations for 2016. When Ms. Kass\u2019s donation was not mentioned, she said she asked whether her gift had been received. There was no record of it or of any donation of that exact amount, she said.Nancy Rotering, the founder and a board member at the legal aid society in suburban Chicago, said her group may have never known about the donation had Ms. Kass not mentioned it. It did not have an account with the Giving Fund, even though its profile page there included its logo, mission statement and tax identification number.\u201cWhy on earth are we on there without our own account to have these funds donated and then to not receive them?\u201d Ms. Rotering said in an interview.Before donating $200 to the soup kitchen in Washington, Ms. Kass said she compared its Giving Fund profile page with its official website, making sure she had the correct group. Everything lined up, she said, so she sent the donation, only to find out later that the DC Central Kitchen did not have an account.\u201cThere was no way for me to know that this soup kitchen was not eligible to receive the money from PayPal,\u201d Ms. Kass said. \u201cThese are small charities that could use every dollar that they can get.\u201d"]},["https://www.nytimes.com//2018/09/21/technology/paypal-blocks-infowars.html","https://www.nytimes.com//video/business/100000006060092/elon-musk-tesla-spacex.html","https://www.nytimes.com//2018/07/11/business/paypal-dead-wife-husband-letter-nyt.html","https://www.nytimes.com//2018/07/27/business/dan-schulman-paypal-corner-office.html","https://www.nytimes.com//2018/05/17/technology/paypal-izettle.html","https://www.nytimes.com//2017/08/04/business/paypal-accounting.html","https://www.nytimes.com//2017/03/01/technology/paypal-giving-fund-lawsuit.html"]]
