[{"2018-06-13":["ALEXANDRIA, Va. \u2014 Karleen Smith used to work at the Macy\u2019s in Landmark Mall, putting price tags on summer dresses, housewares and the latest styles of shoes. On Saturday, Ms. Smith, 57, returned to her former store, not as an employer or a customer, but as a resident. The former Macy\u2019s in this vacant shopping mall outside Washington has been transformed into a homeless shelter. \u201cIt\u2019s weird to be moving into this building. I used to work here,\u201d she said inside the shelter\u2019s common room, which was once the men\u2019s department. \u201cIt\u2019s called survival.\u201d As shopping malls struggle to survive in the era of Amazon, communities are looking for new uses for all the retail space. Some empty stores are finding another life as trampoline parks, offices, college classrooms and churches. At the vacant Macy\u2019s in Alexandria, the Carpenter\u2019s Shelter, a nonprofit group, moved into its temporary home last weekend, 15 months after the last shopper rang out. The former store now provides 60 beds, hot meals and showers for families and for single men and women who are having trouble finding a place to live in a city with a scarcity of affordable housing.The Macy\u2019s logo and signature star are visible above the shelter\u2019s entrance, while some of the floors are covered in the store\u2019s faded carpet and white tiles. Toilets and sinks were pulled from a former Lord & Taylor and relocated to the shelter. The shelter takes up only a corner of the original Macy\u2019s, which occupied two cavernous floors. A fire door at the back of the shelter leads to the rest of the dim store, where the perfume and jewelry counters are still intact and a giant Estee Lauder advertisement remains illuminated.The Landmark Mall was once at the vanguard of shopping. Opened in 1965, the mall housed the region\u2019s most fashionable department stores, Hecht\u2019s, Woodward & Lothrop and Sears & Roebuck. Boys came to buy their first suit at the haberdasher, and teenage girls could get their shoes dyed to match the color of their prom dress.Alexandria\u2019s former mayor William D. Euille remembered playing the clarinet in the high school band at the mall\u2019s opening ceremony. \u201cIt was the economic engine of the city,\u201d he said.Landmark tried to adapt over the years. It began as an open-air shopping center and went through an overhaul in the 1980s to enclose the property. The department stores would change, reflecting the evolving retail landscape. Regional players were replaced by national chains like Lord & Taylor and Macy\u2019s.Eventually, the mall succumbed to retail\u2019s propensity to chase after newer, flashier spaces. Developers built larger malls with more upscale brands nearby in Pentagon City and Tysons Corner, siphoning customers away from Landmark. Landmark\u2019s original anchor stores either have been bought out, went bankrupt or are clinging to life \u2014 like many in the retail business. Last year, 6,985 stores closed in the United States, a record number, according to Coresight Research, a retail analysis and advisory firm. This year, retailers are on a pace to close roughly 10,000 stores.In its final years of operation, the Landmark\u2019s tenants included two dollar stores and a tax preparer. Only the Sears is still operating. A lone, blue inflatable figure dances on the store\u2019s roof, beckoning shoppers.There had been plans to revamp the mall by returning it to its roots as an open-air shopping destination. But that proposal never got off the ground, after its former owner General Growth Properties filed for bankruptcy in 2009, and the mall was sold. Landmark\u2019s current owner, the Howard Hughes Corporation, plans to tear down the mall and build a mixed-used space that could include offices, retail and other attractions that are still being finalized. It could take many more years to complete the planning, permitting and construction process for such a huge project. \u201cIt\u2019s a great piece of real estate,\u201d said Mark Bulmash, a senior vice president of development at Howard Hughes.The delay has created an opportunity for the Carpenter\u2019s Shelter, which began housing the homeless in the basement of a local Catholic church in 1982. The group needed a temporary space while it constructs a permanent facility in a different part of Alexandria that will include 97 affordable rental housing units and a shelter.The mall was one of a few areas in Alexandria where zoning allowed for a shelter. After being approached by a member of the shelter\u2019s board, Howard Hughes agreed to lease a portion of the former Macy\u2019s to the shelter rent free through 2019 and advised on the construction. \u201cThey didn\u2019t have to stick their neck out for this, but they did, and we are grateful,\u201d said Shannon Steene, the shelter\u2019s executive director.Saturday was move-in day for the residents. On a humid, hazy morning, residents loaded onto a chartered city bus at the old shelter and headed for the mall. Keith Ham, 43, who has been living the shelter for about three months, said his family did not believe where he was moving.\u201cThey say, \u2018Macy\u2019s at the mall?\u2019\u201d\u201cAnd I say, \u2018For real, Macy\u2019s at the mall.\u2019\u201dJahlil Commander, 16, dribbled a basketball outside the shelter\u2019s front entrance and watched a movie crew set off a smoke machine in the parking lot. Some of the mall property is also being leased out to a production company filming a \u201cWonder Woman\u201d sequel. Jahlil and his two brothers are sharing a windowless room at the shelter after their mother fell behind on rent. \u201cWe have a predicament,\u201d their mother, Shannon Commander, said. \u201cThis is where we come to reset and figure things out.\u201d Ms. Smith, the former Macy\u2019s worker, rested on the floor of the common room under a frayed green blanket. Before coming to the shelter, Ms. Smith had been living in a car and showering in a recreation center. \u201cI was tired,\u201d she said. Ms. Smith, who worked at Macy\u2019s as a seasonal hire during the holidays 10 years ago, remembers the store fondly. On a slow day, she would try on makeup at the cosmetics counter and spray herself with samples of perfume. She said she could never afford to buy anything of her own. \u201cAll I could do was admire it.\u201dAs Ms. Smith waited to move into her new room, the electricity cut out to a portion of the shelter and the staff set up battery powered camping lanterns to light the way for movers. Volunteers brought crockpots with taco makings for dinner and put together goody bags for the children staying there. The accommodations are sparse and some residents could not hide their disappointment that the bedrooms do not have windows.But 4-year-old Mikias Aiychew was so excited to see his new room at the shelter that he could hardly sit through their weekend Jehovah\u2019s Witness gathering, his mother said.Dressed in a gray suit vest and small brown dress shoes, Mikias played with a plastic castle in the shelter\u2019s new family room.A hand-painted sign on the wall quoted Theodore Roosevelt: \u201cDo what you can with what you have, where you are.\u201d"],"2018-02-08":["Macy\u2019s will introduce a collection of modest clothing, including hijabs, next week, making it the latest company to try to capture a piece of the lucrative Muslim clothing market.The retailer\u2019s Verona Collection, the brainchild of the fashion photographer Lisa Vogl, will debut in stores and online on Feb. 15, with international shipping available.The collection consists of maxi dresses, long tops, hand-dyed hijabs, cardigans and pants \u2014 garments that are priced from $12.95 to $84.95. In a news release, Cassandra Jones, senior vice president of Macy\u2019s Fashion, called the items \u201ceveryday essentials designed for versatility and comfort.\u201dAfter converting to Islam in 2011, Ms. Vogl had difficulty finding modest, fashionable clothing, she said on the Verona Collection website, which led her to create the brand.Last year, she joined Macy\u2019s\u2019 development program, The Workshop, which helps nurture businesses owned by minorities and women.Through the Workshop, it became clear to Macy\u2019s that Ms. Vogl\u2019s brand was \u201ca perfect example of a strong business that provides a unique product that serves a community of women looking for fashionable modest clothing options,\u201d the company said on Thursday.Macy\u2019s also said that customer interest was evident during a pop-up showcase of Workshop vendors last year in Manhattan.Ms. Vogl did not respond to a request for comment.Macy\u2019s has for years struggled with lagging sales, aggravated by the rise of online discount retailers. In November, the department store chain announced that sales had slipped for the 11th consecutive quarter. In 2016, it announced plans to shutter about 100 stores, and closings have been carried out since.The move into Muslim apparel represents an opportunity to capitalize on a robust market.Globally, consumers spent $254 billion in 2016 on Muslim attire, according to the latest Global Islamic Economy report. The report predicted the market could be worth $373 billion by 2022.In 2015, Muslim women spent $44 billion on modest clothing items alone, an earlier Global Islamic Economy report said. \u201cThe clothing may be modest, the success is anything but,\u201d it stated.Luxury retailers, including Dolce & Gabbana and Burberry, have taken notice, as have companies that specialize in trendy casual wear, like Uniqlo, H&M and Zara.Some of these retailers have released collections aimed at Muslim customers who live in the Middle East, but Islamic fashion has also cropped up in the United States in recent years. In 2016, during New York Fashion Week, an Indonesian designer made history with a catwalk show in which every model wore a hijab.\u201cI believe fashion is one of the outlets in which we can start that cultural shift in today\u2019s society to normalize the hijab in America and other parts of the West, so as to break down stereotypes and demystify misconceptions,\u201d the designer, Anniesa Hasibuan, said at the time.Of two billion Muslims worldwide, about nine million are in North America, according to a 2014 study released by the American Muslim Consumer Consortium. The consortium\u2019s founder put Muslim spending power in the United States at about $100 billion.Last year, Nike released a Pro Hijab for Muslim athletes, which is also available on Macy\u2019s\u2019 website, and American Eagle offered customers a limited-edition denim hijab, which sold out.The hijab has also been recognized by one of America\u2019s largest toy retailers. In November, Mattel introduced a hijab-wearing Barbie, part of its \u201cShero\u201d line based on inspirational women. The doll was modeled after the Olympic fencer Ibtihaj Muhammad, the first American athlete to compete in the Olympics in a hijab.But as more companies in the United States have embraced the hijab, women in Iran have been throwing off their head scarves, protesting religious restrictions \u2014 in particular a compulsory rule to cover their hair with an Islamic veil. At least 29 people have been arrested in connection with the protests. A news report said the Tehran Police were \u201cdeceived by the propaganda of a campaign named White Wednesdays\u201d that called for women to remove their veils and wave them overhead on sticks.Muslim head scarves, veils and burqas have also been a flash point in France for over a decade. Women were barred from wearing full-face veils in public places in 2011, and last year the European Union\u2019s highest court said that companies could bar employees from wearing visible religious symbols, including head scarves. In 2016, several French beach towns banned the so-called burkini \u2014 a full-body bathing suit worn by some Muslim women.Some younger people, though, including in the United States, seem to be gaining an appreciation and an understanding of the hijab. Hijab fashion bloggers on Instagram, for example, are abundant and some have millions of followers. And the website Buzzfeed, whose audience skews younger, consistently publishes content about hijab fashion.According to the Global Islamic Economy report, Muslim millennials are considered a powerful and growing economic force that will continue to transform the retail space with digital spending. Half of Muslims today are under 15 years old and nearly two-thirds are 30 or younger."]},["https://www.nytimes.com//2018/06/13/business/macys-homeless-shelter.html","https://www.nytimes.com//2018/02/08/business/macys-hijabs.html","https://www.nytimes.com//2017/11/22/business/macys-retail-real-estate.html"]]
