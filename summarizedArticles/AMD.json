[{"2018-06-25":["Investors have stopped not caring about a trade war.For months, financial markets shrugged off the escalating language and the imposition of tit-for-tat tariffs between the Trump administration and the United States\u2019 most important trading partners, including Canada, Mexico, the European Union and China.But in the past several trading sessions, that apathy has been replaced by what looks like mounting alarm about the prospect of a global race to erect trade barriers.On Monday, the Standard & Poor\u2019s 500-stock index fell sharply, ending the day down 1.4 percent, apparently spooked by signs that the growing trade war could have a negative impact on American companies. That decline, and similar ones in other benchmark indexes like the Dow Jones industrial average, came after the S.& P. slumped 0.9 percent last week.\u201cI think we\u2019re slowly slipping into a more serious stage in the trade war,\u201d said Ethan Harris, head of global economics research at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. \u201cPeople are beginning to realize there\u2019s no sign of de-escalation in sight.\u201dThe sell-off is increasingly broad. Tech shares joined industrials in a sharp fall as American markets opened Monday, after reports that President Trump was considering restrictions on Chinese investments in American technology companies.The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index and the tech sector of the S.&P. 500 both fell more than 2 percent.Semiconductor companies were especially hard hit.The chip makers Micron Technology and AMD fell 6.9 percent and 4.4 percent. Intel dropped 3.4 percent. Concerns about the impact of a trade war seemed to be spreading to some giant tech companies, including Apple, Google\u2019s parent Alphabet, and Microsoft. Because of those companies\u2019 large sizes, moves in their stock prices have big impacts on stock market indexes.Industrials also continued to respond poorly to the trade rancor. The S.&P. 500\u2019s industrial sector fell more than 1 percent, led by drops in American manufacturers like the aircraft maker Boeing and the machinery manufacturer Caterpillar, both of which have large and important markets in China.Harley-Davidson shares dropped nearly 6 percent after the company announced it would be shifting some production to Europe to avoid European tariffs on its motorcycles.The trade war was just one source of anxiety for investors. Among other causes of concern is the flattening of the so-called yield curve, which some worry could portend tough economic times ahead, even though the United States economy currently is robust."],"2018-01-18":["OTTAWA \u2014 John Tory, the mayor of the only city outside the United States to make the list of 20 finalists for Amazon\u2019s second headquarters displayed some typical Canadian modesty on Thursday. Toronto, Mr. Tory said, had only \u201cmade the playoffs.\u201dBut regardless of the outcome, the announcement that the city remains a contender showed how much progress Toronto, and the surrounding region, have made in establishing themselves as a major technology center.Nine communities in the Toronto region put forward a joint bid for the headquarters. Those towns are already home to a major Google engineering operation, a major artificial intelligence research center and a quantum computing institute. General Motors is adding about 1,000 software engineers to the area who will, among other things, develop systems for self-driving cars, and Thomson Reuters has made Toronto a technology hub, a move that could create 1,500 jobs. And a unit of Google\u2019s parent company, Alphabet, is developing plans to turn a derelict portion of Toronto\u2019s waterfront into a high-tech city of the future.Amazon offered few details on Thursday about how it had come up with its 20 finalists. Unlike several other finalists, the region offered no tax or other incentives. But Mr. Tory said he believed that the area had two important virtues.One is Canada\u2019s immigration policy. Mr. Tory said that when he was recently in New York, he found a great deal of interest among American executives in Canada\u2019s relatively new immigration program that gives visas to certain skilled workers within two weeks. That\u2019s light speed compared with the complicated American system. And unlike the United States, Canada does not limit how many of those visas can be issued each year.In sharp contrast to President Trump\u2019s efforts to limit the entry of people from some predominately Muslim countries into the United States, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has repeatedly emphasized that Canada is open to people of all religions and backgrounds.\u201cWe\u2019re able to attract the best and the brightest from around the world,\u201d Mr. Tory said.Toronto\u2019s second asset, he said, is its publicly funded university and college system. The University of Waterloo has long been recognized as one of North America\u2019s top technology schools, and the University of Toronto is a major center for research in artificial intelligence. As part of the area\u2019s Amazon pitch, the province of Ontario has increased funding for artificial intelligence programs at its universities by 30 million Canadian dollars, or about $24 million.\u201cWe have a talent pool, and we have the educational policies to make sure the pipeline is full,\u201d Mr. Tory said.But the Toronto area also has a potentially unattractive feature: ever-escalating prices both for homes and for commercial real estate. Its bid proposes several potential sites for Amazon\u2019s second headquarters, among them the largely abandoned docklands that include the Google-related redevelopment plan.Frank Scarpitti, the mayor of Markham, Ontario, which is already home to operations of IBM and the chip maker AMD, dismissed the idea that land and housing prices could be a deal breaker. He noted that several other finalists, including New York, had similar or higher costs.Soon after the announcement, Kathleen Wynne, the premier of Ontario, appointed Ed Clark, the former president and chief executive of the Toronto-Dominion Bank, to coordinate the province\u2019s reply.Mr. Tory said the cities would probably have to wait for Amazon\u2019s next move before taking any action of their own.\u201cWe don\u2019t know what they\u2019re expecting from us,\u201d he said. \u201cThere has been no playbook or playoff schedule supplied to the 20 finalists.\u201d"],"2018-05-08":["SAN FRANCISCO \u2014 Two technology booms \u2014 some people might call them frenzies \u2014 are combining to turn a once-obscure type of microprocessor into a must-have but scarce commodity.Artificial intelligence systems, made by companies ranging in size from Google to the Chinese start-up Malong Technologies, rely heavily on a computer chip called a graphics processing unit, or G.P.U. The chips are also very useful in mining digital currencies like Ethereum, a Bitcoin alternative riding the same wave of hype as its more famous cousin.With people and companies involved in the two surging tech niches buying up the same chips, G.P.U.s have been in short supply over the past several months. Prices have increased by as much as 50 percent, according to some resellers and customers.\u201cThe chips are simply going out of stock,\u201d said Matt Scott, a technologist from the United States who founded Malong after leaving Microsoft\u2019s research lab in Beijing in 2014. \u201cAnd the problem is getting worse.\u201dMalong, based in Shenzhen, is building a system that can analyze digital photos and learn to recognize objects. Doing so requires an enormous number of photos, and analyzing all these photos depends on the G.P.U. chip.When the company recently ordered new hardware from a supplier in China, the shipment was delayed by four weeks. And the price of the chips was about 15 percent higher than it had been six months earlier.\u201cWe need the latest G.P.U.s to stay competitive,\u201d Mr. Scott said. \u201cThere is a tangible impact to our research work.\u201dBut he did not blame other A.I. specialists for the shortage. He blamed cryptocurrency miners. \u201cWe have never had this problem before,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was only when crypto got hot that we saw a significant slowdown in our ability to get G.P.U.s.\u201dG.P.U.s were originally designed to render graphics for computer games and other software. In recent years, they have become an essential tool in the creation of artificial intelligence. Almost every A.I. company relies on the chips.Like Malong, those companies build what are called neural networks, complex algorithms that learn tasks by analyzing vast amounts of data. Large numbers of G.P.U.s, which consume relatively little electrical power and can be packed into a small space, can process the huge amounts of math required by neural networks more efficiently than standard chips.Speculators in digital currency are snapping up G.P.U.s for a very different purpose. After setting up machines that help run the large computer networks that manage Ethereum and other Bitcoin alternatives, people and businesses can receive payment in the form of newly created digital coins. G.P.U.s are also efficient for processing the math required for this digital mining.Crypto miners bought three million G.P.U. boards \u2014 flat panels that can be added to personal and other computers \u2014 worth $776 million last year, said Jon Peddie, a researcher who has tracked sales of the chips for decades.That may not sound like a lot in an overall market worth more than $15 billion, but the combination of A.I. builders and crypto miners \u2014 not to mention gamers \u2014 has squeezed the G.P.U. supply. Things have gotten so tight that resellers for Nvidia, the Silicon Valley chip maker that produces 70 percent of the G.P.U. boards, often restrict how many a company can buy each day.\u201cIt is a tough moment,\u201d said Kevin Scott, Microsoft\u2019s chief technology officer. \u201cWe could do more if we had more of these\u201d chips in data centers. \u201cThere are real products that could be getting better right now for real users. This is not a theoretical exercise.\u201dAMD, another G.P.U. supplier, and other companies say some of the current shortage is a result of a limited worldwide supply of other components on G.P.U. boards, and they note that retail prices have begun to stabilize. But in March, at his company\u2019s annual chip conference in Silicon Valley, Nvidia\u2019s chief executive, Jen-Hsun Huang, indicated that the company still could not produce the chips fast enough.This has created an opportunity for many other chip makers. A company called Bitmain, for instance, has released a new chip specifically for mining Ethereum coins. Google has built its own chip for work on A.I. and is giving other companies access to it through a cloud computing service. Last month, Facebook indicated in a series of online job postings that it, too, was working to build a chip just for A.I.Dozens of other companies are designing similar chips that take the already specialized G.P.U. into smaller niches, and more companies producing chips means a greater supply and lower prices.\u201cYou want this not just for economic reasons, but for supply chain stability,\u201d said Mr. Scott of Microsoft.The market will not diversify overnight. Matthew Zeiler, the chief executive and founder of a computer-vision start-up in New York, said the prices of some of the G.P.U. boards that the company uses have risen more than 40 percent since last year.Mr. Zeiler believes that Nvidia will be very hard to unseat. Many companies will stick with the Nvidia\u2019s technology because that is what they are familiar with, and because the G.P.U. boards it provides can do more than one thing.Kevin Zhang, the founder of ABC Consulting, has bought thousands of G.P.U.s for mining various digital currencies. He said that a chip just for, say, mining Ethereum was not necessarily an attractive option for miners. It cannot be used to mine other currencies, and the groups that run systems like Ethereum often change the underlying technology, which can make dedicated chips useless.Interest in digital currency mining could cool, of course. But the A.I. and gaming markets will continue to grow.Mr. Zeiler said that his company had recently bought new G.P.U.s for its data center in New Jersey, but could not install them for more than a month because the computer racks needed to house the chips were in short supply as a result of the same market pressures.\u201cThe demand,\u201d he said, \u201cis definitely crazy.\u201d"],"2018-02-12":["MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. \u2014 A few years ago, Google created a new kind of computer chip to help power its giant artificial intelligence systems. These chips were designed to handle the complex processes that some believe will be a key to the future of the computer industry.On Monday, the internet giant said it would allow other companies to buy access to those chips through its cloud-computing service. Google hopes to build a new business around the chips, called tensor processing units, or T.P.U.s.\u201cWe are trying to reach as many people as we can as quickly as we can,\u201d said Zak Stone, who works alongside the small team of Google engineers that designs these chips.Google\u2019s move highlights several sweeping changes in the way modern technology is built and operated. Google is in the vanguard of a movement to design chips specifically for artificial intelligence, a worldwide push that includes dozens of start-ups as well as familiar names like Intel, Qualcomm and Nvidia.And these days, companies like Google, Amazon and Microsoft are not just big internet companies. They are big hardware makers.As a way of cutting costs and improving the efficiency of the multibillion-dollar data centers that underpin its online empire, Google designs much of the hardware inside these massive facilities, from the computer servers to the networking gear that ties these machines together. Other internet giants do much the same.In addition to its T.P.U. chips, which sit inside its data centers, the company has designed an A.I. chip for its smartphones.Right now, Google\u2019s new service is focused on a way to teach computers to recognize objects, called computer vision technology. But as time goes on, the new chips will also help businesses build a wider range of services, Mr. Stone said.At the end of last year, hoping to accelerate its work on driverless cars, Lyft began testing Google\u2019s new chips.Using the chips, Lyft wanted to accelerate the development of systems that allow driverless cars to, say, identify street signs or pedestrians. \u201cTraining\u201d these systems can take days, but with the new chips, the hope is that this will be reduced to hours.\u201cThere is huge potential here,\u201d said Anantha Kancherla, who oversees software for the Lyft driverless car project.T.P.U. chips have helped accelerate the development of everything from the Google Assistant, the service that recognizes voice commands on Android phones, to Google Translate, the internet app that translates one language into another.They are also reducing Google\u2019s dependence on chip makers like Nvidia and Intel. In a similar move, it designed its own servers and networking hardware, reducing its dependence on hardware makers like Dell, HP and Cisco.This keeps costs down, which is essential when running a large online operation, said Casey Bisson, who helps oversee a cloud computing service called Joyent, which is owned by Samsung. At times, the only way to build an efficient service is to build your own hardware.\u201cThis is about packing as much computing power as possible within a small area, within a heat budget, within a power budget,\u201d Mr. Bisson said.A new wave of artificial intelligence, including services like Google Assistant, are driven by \u201cneural networks,\u201d which are complex algorithms that can learn tasks on their own by analyzing vast amounts of data. By analyzing a database of old customer support phone calls, for example, a neural network can learn to recognize commands spoken into a smartphone. But this requires serious computing power.Typically, engineers train these algorithms using graphics processing units, or G.P.U.s, which are chips that were originally designed for rendering images for games and other graphics-heavy software. Most of these chips are supplied by Nvidia.In designing its own A.I. chips, Google was looking to exceed what was possible with these graphics-oriented chips, speed up its own A.I. work and lure more businesses onto its cloud services.At the same time, Google has gained some independence from Nvidia and an ability to negotiate lower prices with its chip suppliers.\u201cGoogle has become so big, it makes sense to invest in chips,\u201d said Fred Weber, who spent a decade as the chief technology officer at the chip maker AMD. \u201cThat gives them leverage. They can cut out the middleman.\u201dThis does not mean that Google will stop buying chips from Nvidia and other chip makers. But it is altering the market. \u201cWho\u2019s buying and who\u2019s selling has changed,\u201d Mr. Weber said.Over the years, Google has even flirted with the possibility of designing its own version of the chips it buys from Intel.Mr. Weber and other insiders question whether Google would ever do this, just because a C.P.U. is so complex and it would be so much more difficult to design and maintain one of these chips. But at a private event in San Francisco last fall, David Patterson, a computer science professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who now works on chip technologies at Google, was asked if the company would go that far.\u201cThat\u2019s not rocket science,\u201d he said."]},["https://www.nytimes.com//2018/06/25/business/stock-markets-activity.html","https://www.nytimes.com//2018/01/18/business/why-toronto-made-the-playoffs-for-amazons-headquarters.html","https://www.nytimes.com//2018/05/08/technology/gpu-chip-shortage.html","https://www.nytimes.com//2018/02/12/technology/google-artificial-intelligence-chips.html"]]
