[{"2018-09-21":["NAVASSA, N.C. \u2014 With floodwaters continuing to rise in the wake of Hurricane Florence, state officials and environmentalists are closely monitoring the breach of a dam that has flooded a hazardous stockpile of coal ash, some of which has spilled into the Cape Fear River.On Friday, Duke Energy shut down a power plant near Wilmington after a dam breach between 100 and 200 feet wide, at the south end of Sutton Lake, allowed floodwaters to swamp two basins containing huge stockpiles of arsenic-laced ash.Duke\u2019s L.V. Sutton facility has been a focus of increasing concern for environmentalists and regulators since last week, when rains from Hurricane Florence caused a coal ash landfill at the site to erode, spilling waste onto a local roadway.Coal ash is the powdery substance that remains after burning coal. The Environmental Protection Agency links the substances that it contains \u2014 including heavy metals like arsenic and lead \u2014 to nervous-system problems, reproductive issues and cancer.It was not immediately clear how much ash was released. The extent of the threat will depend on how quickly the breach can be stopped, state officials said.The state is still reeling from record-breaking flooding that has left many of the region\u2019s roads, including a long stretch of Interstate 95 south of the Virginia border, closed to traffic.And the danger of more flooding remains. The Cape Fear River is scheduled to crest tomorrow morning at 31.3 feet, more than seven feet above its historic flood stage. Water levels will remain high through Tuesday.Coal ash is not the only pollutant to cause North Carolina woes in the wake of Florence. The state is home to 9.7 million pigs that produce 10 billion gallons of manure each year. Most of that manure is stored in large earthen lagoons. In the wake of Florence and the record-breaking amount of water the storm has poured onto the region, a growing number of those lagoons are flooding. [At least three infants were among the victims of Hurricane Florence. ]As of midday on Friday, at least 54 lagoons have discharged their waste into the environment, another 76 are at risk of doing so, and six have some form of structural damage that may have led to the release of pig feces. The number is expected to increase as more farmers return to their land.State inspectors, who conducted a drone survey of the area on Friday, said there appeared to be \u201cno structural issues\u201d with the inner containment walls, or impoundments, of the basins, according to Bridget Munger, spokeswoman for the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality.They are monitoring the situation in \u201creal time\u201d and plan to conduct an investigation into the causes of the failure once the situation has stabilized, Ms. Munger said in an email.The dam was inspected within the last month and no major problems were discovered, state officials said.\u201cThis is a crisis that we\u2019re addressing but it\u2019s in the context of a huge state emergency, so that\u2019s just part of the big picture for us,\u201d Ms. Munger said.Gov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina said in a statement on Friday that \u201ca thorough investigation of events will soon follow to ensure that Duke Energy is held responsible for any environmental impacts by their coal ash facilities.\u201dA spokesperson for the Environmental Protection Agency said the agency had not been out to the site, and that it would lend its support to state officials at their request.As state officials fretted over the plant, residents and workers in the surrounding area were impatient to get back to their daily routines and were concerned about potential damage.\u201cThe dam really worries me. The idea that it could spill over and spread chemicals is really concerning,\u201d said Charles Holliday, 27, who was clearing out debris from his family\u2019s yard in the small town of Navassa, the nearest residential area to the plant. \u201cThis whole area has a lot of industrial plants and chemicals and that kind of thing. So you add it all up and, yes, it\u2019s something we are all going to get a little panicked about.\u201dThe river has already spread hundreds of yards beyond its banks, turning the piney flats west of Wilmington into a muddy lagoon punctured by tilting trees and half-submerged railroad bridges.The plant itself, cordoned off by security but visible from a highway overpass, was covered by a thin pool of water, with the area closest to the lake appearing to be the most inundated.Peter Harrison, a lawyer with Earthjustice, an environmental nonprofit, took a boat on the river to see the site himself. He said that there were multiple places where the dam around the lake had breached, and that the lake water was pouring into the river. From what he could see, he added, the lake water appeared full of coal ash. \u201cYou can just see that swirling down the river for like miles and miles,\u201d Mr. Harrison said.Avner Vengosh, a professor of earth and ocean sciences at Duke University, said, \u201cWe\u2019ll probably never know how much has spilled into the river.\u201d Because the spill stems from large-scale flooding over a wide area, it\u2019s difficult to calculate how much ash is entering the river.The breach of the dam imperils two unlined coal ash ponds on site, which contain a combined 2.1 million cubic yards of coal ash, according to a report prepared for Duke Energy this year. That amount of coal ash would fill a large sports stadium.Scrutiny of coal ash has increased since 2008, when the Kingston Fossil Plant in Harriman, Tenn., spilled 5.4 million cubic yards of coal ash into the environment. The cleanup cost more than $1 billion.Last week, the storm caused a coal ash landfill at the Duke plant to erode, spilling about 2,000 cubic yards of the ash onto an adjacent roadway.The spill was quickly cleaned up, the company said. But the Waterkeeper Alliance, an environmental group, disputed that, saying at least some of the coal ash remains in the area.In 2014 Duke Energy\u2019s Dan River plant in Eden, N.C., spilled 39,000 tons of coal ash into the Dan River, prompting the state to order all of Duke\u2019s coal ash ponds closed. That process is not yet complete.In May 2015, the Justice Department announced a $102 million fine against Duke Energy after the utility pleaded guilty to nine criminal violations of the Clean Water Act at several of its North Carolina facilities.The fine included a $68 million criminal penalty and $34 million for environmental projects and land conservation to benefit rivers and wetlands in North Carolina and Virginia. Four of the nine charges were related to the Dan River spill. The other violations were based on allegations of historical violations at the company\u2019s other operations.The L.V. Sutton plant now burns natural gas, but until 2013 it housed a three-unit, 575-megawatt coal-fired plant. The coal ash from that operation remains on site, with the oldest of the ash basins dating back to 1971.The coal ash landfill at Duke\u2019s L.V. Sutton plant, which spilled last week, was supposed to provide secure storage for the site\u2019s two coal ash ponds, but the fact that it is already failing now has some environmental groups questioning its structural integrity.\u201cYou know the thing with the Tennessee Valley river spill, and the same thing with the Dan River spill, a lot of that ash was never recovered,\u201d Lisa Evans, a lawyer with Earthjustice, said. \u201cIf you spill into a lake and that lake water continues to spill into that river rapidly, you\u2019re going to have maybe even a bigger cleanup problem.\u201d\u201cIf you have two million tons of ash going into that lake,\u201d Ms. Evans added, \u201cthat lake is dead.\u201dFor more news on climate and the environment, follow @NYTClimate on Twitter.Ivan Penn contributed reporting from Los Angeles."],"2018-08-24":["Want climate news in your inbox?

The crowd, a mix of black and white faces, filled the pews in what was ostensibly the black side of town, straining the capacity of this good-sized church.On the dais stood the Rev. Dr. William J. Barber II, draped in a black robe, a black vest and a cream stole emblazoned with the credo \u201cJesus was a poor man.\u201d Al Gore, the former vice president, sat behind him. Dr. Barber\u2019s message to the community members in the church last week would have been largely recognizable to civil rights leaders of generations past, addressing issues of poverty and racism. But he and Mr. Gore were here in Greensboro to focus on another concern that many in the audience believed was just as insidious: pollution from North Carolina\u2019s coal-powered electrical plants.\u201cJesus said love your neighbor,\u201d Dr. Barber told the crowd. \u201cI don\u2019t care how many times you tell me you love me, if you put coal ash in my water you don\u2019t love me. Because if there was nothing wrong with the coal ash, then put it in the wealthy communities.\u201dFifty years after the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. started a movement known as the Poor People\u2019s Campaign, Dr. Barber has been working to revive it. He is perhaps best known as the architect of the Forward Together Moral Movement protests in North Carolina that opposed voting-rights restrictions and helped defeat the Republican governor in 2016. Now he is making environmental justice, and climate change, a pillar of a modern-day war on poverty.Dr. Barber and Mr. Gore spent two days touring nearby towns, drawing attention to environmental issues and making it clear that voters could act on them come Election Day. Lower-income communities \u2014 especially black, Hispanic and Native American ones \u2014 tend to be more polluted and bear more of the burden of climate change than higher-income and white communities, experts say.Dr. Barber rejected the notion that these were partisan issues. \u201cThis is the real question, not if Democrats are going to get elected, not if Republicans are going to get elected, but if America is going to be America, she\u2019s going to have to address systemic racism, systemic poverty, ecological devastation, the war economy and militarism, and our false moral narrative of religious nationalism,\u201d he said.Mr. Gore, well known for his work on global warming, said the issues of coal pollution and climate change were linked. \u201cBoth are necessary byproducts of our addiction to fossil fuels,\u201d he said.The two men visited Belews Creek, a predominantly black community in a predominantly white county that resides in the shadow of the Belews Creek Steam Station, a coal-fired power plant.All coal plants generate coal ash, the hazardous powdery substance that remains after burning coal. Many plants, including the Belews Creek facility, store it on site, mixed with water in storage ponds. But a lawsuit filed in December by the Southern Environmental Law Center says that because the active storage pond at Belews Creek lacks a protective lining, it is seeping into the groundwater.The E.P.A. links the substances in coal ash \u2014 including heavy metals like arsenic and lead \u2014 to nervous-system problems, reproductive issues and cancer. Still, the agency last month overhauled Obama-era regulations on coal ash disposal, granting more authority to states and industry. Separately, the E.P.A. this week loosened rules on air pollution from coal plants and estimated the change would result in up to 1,400 premature deaths annually by 2030.\u201cI think most people assume that when you live in the country that you would have clean air and water,\u201d said Danielle Bailey-Lash, who moved to Belews Creek in 2005 but left in 2015 after she learned she had brain cancer. She does not know whether coal pollution or other factors caused it.Belews Creek is a prime example of the kinds of communities threatened by coal ash pollution, said Lisa Evans, a lawyer for the environmental group Earthjustice, which is not involved in the suit. \u201cCoal ash ponds are in rural areas, particularly in the Southeast. Those communities have less power and less of a voice,\u201d she said.\u201cThose are the areas that do not have municipal water systems to filter and clean the water,\u201d Ms. Evans added. \u201cWhen you contaminate groundwater in a rural area, that\u2019s their lifeline.\u201dThe lawsuit says that Duke Energy, the plant\u2019s owner, is dumping untreated coal ash pollution directly into surface water at the Belews Creek plant, and that the coal ash pond is leaking into surface water and the connected groundwater. The plaintiffs include the environmental group Appalachian Voices North Carolina and the state and county branches of the N.A.A.C.P.A federal district judge last week denied Duke Energy\u2019s motion to dismiss the suit.Duke says its studies and outside experts agree there is no evidence that the Belews Creek facility is polluting nearby drinking water wells. \u201cWe\u2019ve got good evidence that tells us that the drinking water wells remain very safe, and that the groundwater impacts around the basin are well-defined and well understood and not impacting the neighbors,\u201d said Paige Sheehan, a spokeswoman for the utility.Avner Vengosh, a professor of earth and ocean sciences at Duke University, said the situation was complicated. In his research, he has found evidence of coal ash contamination in surface water in North Carolina, but has not found contamination in the region\u2019s drinking wells.Generally, however, unlined coal ash ponds do leak into groundwater, according to a 2016 study published by Dr. Vengosh and his colleagues. And Dr. Vengosh said his team had not tested every drinking well in the area. \u201cAre there wells that we have not studied that could potentially have been affected? Absolutely,\u201d he said.Human exposure to toxins generated by coal plants can also come from atmospheric pollution and from airborne particles that settle onto surfaces, Dr. Vengosh said.Leslie Bray Brewer, a pastor who grew up in Belews Creek, remembers what life was like in the late 1970s and early \u201980s, a few years after the plant opened. Coal ash \u201cwas everywhere \u2014 the soil, the car, our roofs,\u201d she said.She said her children later suffered breathing problems. \u201cThen we started to put two and two together that a lot of the neighbors were having these issues,\u201d she said.\u201cThere\u2019s actually people down there that have to bathe in bottled water,\u201d said David Hairston, a board member of Appalachian Voices and a native of the region. \u201cThat\u2019s how fearful they are.\u201dIn 2014, a drainage pipe collapsed under a coal ash pond at Duke Energy\u2019s Dan River Steam Station, roughly 35 miles northeast of Belews Creek, spilling millions of gallons of sludge along 70 miles of the Dan River. It was the second-largest such disaster in the United States.Afterward, the state ordered Duke to close 32 coal ash ponds. The company\u2019s plan at Belews Creek is to drain the pond but leave the ash in place, filling the structure with soil and capping it with a weatherproof cover. Environmentalists want Duke to excavate the coal ash completely.Ms. Sheehan, the Duke spokeswoman, said excavation at Belews Creek would be risky and costly. The lawsuit \u201cwas filed by a number of critic organizations who want to burden people with excavation,\u201d she said. \u201cCapping is supported by the science and the engineering.\u201dIf North Carolina has a history of environmental problems, it also has a history of environmental protest.\u201cWhere did the environmental justice movement begin?\u201d Mr. Gore asked after taking the lectern at Shiloh Baptist. \u201cIt began right here in North Carolina in 1982 in Warren County.\u201dHe was referring to an E.P.A. plan at the time to situate a landfill, designed to hold 50,000 tons of soil contaminated with the chemicals known as PCBs, in a community that was 65 percent black. Residents led six weeks of primarily peaceful protests, including laying in the road to block trucks.It is not hard to draw connections to other protesters who put their bodies on the line. Less than a mile from the pulpit, a historic Woolworth\u2019s lunch counter is now part of a civil rights museum in Greensboro. A 1960 sit-in at the segregated counter, led by four black college students, helped catalyze a movement that desegregated restaurants across the South.Before they became famous for their protest, at least two of the group, which became known as the Greensboro Four, attended Shiloh Baptist.For more news on climate and the environment, follow @NYTClimate on Twitter."]},["https://www.nytimes.com//2018/09/21/climate/florences-floodwaters-breach-defenses-at-power-plant-prompting-shutdown.html","https://www.nytimes.com//2018/08/24/climate/coal-ash-pollution-poverty.html"]]
